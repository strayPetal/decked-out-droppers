# Decked Out Droppers
A simple little Minecraft mod that prevents (most of) the droppers in the game, Decked Out 2 designed and built on Hermitcraft S9 by Tango Tek, from running out of items, allowing you to play forever without worrying about the looming prospect of your droppers eventually running out and the dread of having to refill them again.

_I, or this mod, are in no way affiliated with the Hermitcraft SMP, Tango, etc. I'm just some random person who got addicted to Decked Out and doesn't want to and doesn't know how to properly refill those droppers, so made this mod instead._

**Download via GitHub Releases**: [Latest](/../../releases/latest)\
I don't really have any plans to put this up on Modrinth cause lazy.

You can grab the Hermitcraft S9 world download from https://hermitcraft.com/ and play Decked Out 2 for yourself too!

Tango has a very nice explainer video for those who aren't familiar with the game here: [How to Play Decked Out 2!](https://youtu.be/aoVVCwx6k1w)

## The specifics
**What this mod covers:**
- **floor loot** - coins, crowns, embers, all 3 types of keys, repair kits, pumpkins, and the bomb.
- **artifact compasses**
- **Decked Out maps**
- **all 28 artifacts and their corresponding artifakes**
- **victory tomes**

**What isn't covered:**
- **cards** - cards aren't covered because this will mess up with the card handling system. Refill at ember shop periodically.
  - **porkchops** (Pork Chop Power or Halloween area) - impossible to differentiate from other porkchops dispensed from dispensers. Refill above the starting area for Pork Chop Power, and at the Halloween area.
- **armor for Suit Up** - same as above. Refill above starting area.
